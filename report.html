                <div class="text">Our audit trail is a bit empty, as Dong was our main coder, he has the most experience with HTML & CSS, so he had the most commits to GitHub. We did work on it together during our meetups, however, he did do most of the work on GitHub. It was also emptier during the early weeks of the projects, as we were trying to learn HTML & CSS, we wanted to be assured with our capabilities before fully tackling the project.
                    </div>
        <div class="head1">Project Description</div> 
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Topic</div>
            <div class="text">For our project, we propose a website centered around photography, with freelancing photographers able to advertise and promote their own profile. This website is also for people in Vietnam that are looking for a photographer with fitting specialization for their specific needs. When you register an account on this website, you’re able to register as 2 roles, a client or a photographer. As a photographer, you’ll be able to customize your profile in whatever way you like, such as your price per hour, specialization, including a showcase of your previous and/or best work, and even extra work such as photo editing. As a client, you're actively looking for a photographer, you’ll be presented with many different photographers, which you’re able to filter through to your liking, such as price per hour, specific specialization (such as wedding photos, tourist photos, etc…).
                <br><br>
                Our purpose with this project is to help build the community and passion behind photography in Vietnam. It’s very difficult to try and start a photography career, as one would most likely start off by helping their friends and family, trying to spread through word of mouth. We live in the age of the Internet and technology, but still trying to start your business through word of mouth is simply inefficient. There are other websites that photographers could register on and spread their work there, but due to their widespread demographic being all over the globe, it brings up issues such as language barrier, travel barrier, it makes work and being hired hard to pull off. That’s why our website wants to focus specifically on photographers in Vietnam, as focusing on our demographic within a single country would help us reach them and understand them on a deeper level.
            </div>
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Motivation</div>
            <div class="text">We’ve had a thorough look at similar products, who are our potential competitors, with platforms such as Fiverr, Portfoliobox, and Upwork. Websites like Fiverr are universal freelancing websites, they have countless people in multiple for different jobs, with most of these jobs being delivered online. Portfoliobox allows their users to be able to build a website to showcase their work and customize it however they like. We believe that specializing in photography freelancers specifically, will help us provide better quality services compared to Fiverr, and allowing not only freelancers, but also clients to utilize the website would allow more users on the website. However, the website that is the most familiar to us would be Upwork, allowing usage for both clients and freelancers alike, focusing on photography, and they even have a region in Vietnam. Our biggest factor and advantage compared to all 3 of these websites, is that we are dedicated to Vietnam only, focusing on a single demographic would allow better communication and connection. Would a photographer sign up for a website with 50 countries, and Vietnam just so happen to be one of them, or would they pick a website specifically designed towards Vietnam? Focusing on a country may seem like a potential drawback at first, but Vietnam is a second-world country with a population of around 90 million, with a very high tourist count, the potential users are countless.

            </div>
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Aims</div>
            <div class="text">For our single grand aim and purpose would be to help freelancing photographers promote their work and for clients to look for them with ease. When making the project, we aim to satisfy both the freelancers and the clients, we view them as equally important customers. The photographers would not be on this website if there were no clients for them, and the clients would not be on this website if there wasn’t a photographer that they needed for their occasion. Without one or the other, the website would not be able to function, and thus eventually be shut down, thus, satisfaction on both sides is our ultimate objective. Other goals that we aim on this project would be to allow as much customizability to a photographer’s profile as possible, and make looking for a photographer quick and easy.
            <br><br>
            Customization to a photographer’s profile isn’t necessarily a requirement to make this website function, however we view it as very beneficial to the website if we could pull it off. The most important thing for almost any business, us and the photographer included, would be first impressions. When a client clicks on a photographer’s profile, and it all looks the same except with different examples and different numbers, it would be hard for some to stand out. However, if a photographer has control over their profile, they’re able to make it glamorous and eye-catching to potential customers. This is also beneficial on the client’s side, they could feel the passion and personality that went into a photographer’s profile, and could help speed up their decision making in which photographer to choose from.
            <br><br>
            Another objective that we aim for is to help searching for photographers as quickly as possible. The previous goal also assists in this, but we view this as a separate goal, as it pertains to features such as filters. If our website were to grow, having to choose from a list of very talented photographers would be difficult and time consuming for clients. We aim to include features in our website to speed things up, such as filtering price range, types of photography, photographer rating, most hired this month, etc… Helping them choose photographers quicker, would also help the photographers themselves from getting more clients.
            </div>
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Plans & Progress</div>
            <div class="text">We initially had no plans on doing a project with any sort of photography at all. Our ideas all sparked from a meeting we had, which lasted about an hour. It was difficult to come up with an idea as this was our first time taking an IT course, whether it was our first year, first semester, or just first IT course in general. Not to mention, one great issue was our struggle to communicate. Two of us had just entered college, with the other being in his final year, so a difference of age combined with a whole new college environment made it difficult to communicate with each other. However, we did manage to break that ice barrier and we began communicating with each other. We began exchanging questions in the meeting, to get an idea on our project, ranging from does anyone have connections to anyone, what sort of work experiences did we have in the past, but we finally landed on the question what’s an interest we all have in common. We began exchanging interests, and everyone has a spark of interest in photography, whether we tried it out once in a high school club, or are really passionate about it. After landing on photography, we were considering what we could do with it, whether it be an app or a website. We began listing out examples of what we could potentially, listing out sites like Fiverr, and Portfoliobox. It was at the end of the meeting that we finally landed on the idea, a freelancing photography website, specifically dedicated towards Vietnam.
                <br><br>
                In terms of the functionalities of our projects, we of course aim to have a lot of features. When one first glances at the website, we intend to introduce ourselves, what the website is, what we’re doing, but most importantly, explain why we believe we are better than our competitors, with our greatest advantage being that we are focusing on Vietnam’s demographic. When they sign up for the website, they will have a choice to sign up as a client looking for photographers, or a freelancing photographer, looking to promote their work. Both of these options would require them to fill out personal information, as due to running an online website, we intend on taking cybersecurity very seriously, in order to prevent any form of fraud, scams, or any malicious activities on the website. Providing features to the users would be our utmost priority, starting with photographers, we intend for them to customizable their profiles and portfolios with as much creativity as we can possibly give them. Realistically, there are limitations, in order to keep their portfolios understandable, and to even prevent anything malicious from being done, but they are still able to stand out and fill their portfolio/profile with personality and passion. After customizing their profile, they’re able to fill out the important information, such as price per hour, types of specialization in photography, extra activities such as photo editing, and the most important being examples of past works, etc… As for clients, they’re able to filter through many photographers, such as looking for a price range, inside a specific city in Vietnam, what type of photography they specialize in, how well they’re rated, etc… Users would also be granted recommendations, in order to help promote some more obscure photographers, as to not have some dominate the website, and to help them make a decision if they are struggling on picking a photographer.
                <br><br>
                Progression on the project after that slowed down a bit, due to numerous reasons, such as an exam coming up, a scheduled meeting being canceled due to work or other courses, or simply because of our social anxiety to talk to each other after a period of silence in the group chat. Luckily however, we managed to get back into the swing of continuing the work, and we began developing our project further, this continued during our IT tutorials week of beginning to learn HTML, that’s when we could truly start developing our mock up website. However, due to it being very new to us, we decided to dedicate a lot of time to playing around with it, in the hopes of understanding it better, which helped a lot with the development of the project. We further learned about CSS, which is a style-sheet language which is required in a lot of web developing. It helps us further decorate our website in comparison to what we’ve only learned with HTML. After understanding HTML and learning CSS, we believed that we were ready to begin working on the website, as the deadline for the presentation and the project is approaching soon.
                <br><br>
                As we are all new IT students, making a fully functional website is a step in the future, so for now, we should focus on making what we can, which is a mockup website. So we divided the roles up, on and off we would divide work between the report, the upcoming presentation, and the website itself. However, one major problem was starting to show its thorn, and it was a lack of communication with a certain member. They had done little to no work, and responded in 1-2 word replies over periods of days in communication. They eventually didn’t even show up to the presentation of our project. So we respectfully parted ways with them, however, 3 people left to work on a project aimed at 4-5 people that was going to be a tough issue, but we persisted through regardless. Workload began to pile up as we as individuals had to do 33-66% more work compared to groups with 4-5 people. Without a doubt, this was our biggest problem that we had to overcome during the process of working on this project.  We overcame it through a lot of meetings with each other, in order to keep each other focused and motivated on their work, meeting in person would allow for more consistency and minimize distraction. Admittedly, we did have to cut a lot of features from our mock-up website, and from our overall design, but in the end, we’re proud of what we have finished with. In terms of the stage of the project, we’re missing a few important pages from the mockup website, which could use more details and decorations, however, I think we’ve made good progress.
            </div>
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Scope & Limits</div>
            <div class="text">Starting off with scope, our scope for the project was intentionally designed to be a global website, aimed at people of multiple different countries, designed as an online community of photographers. We soon came to realize that having a scope too big for a project would become a drawback, so we decided to shrink our scope and focus on Vietnam specifically. However, after some more further considerations, we began to realize that focusing on Vietnam specifically began to come up as a business advantage more than a drawback. Our limitations for making this project idea into an actual website is limited by our contacts, and our coding ability. There are some features we can’t make just yet, as we are early into our IT career. To continue this project would mean to reach out for hire, such as potential investors, advertisements for this project, and hiring coders who could continue such a project.
            </div>
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Roles</div>
            <div class="text">For our group, we didn’t specifically design a particular role for each participant, however, those roles sort of grew on us, depending on what we specialized in, but we all helped each other work on their part at some point. Bui was dedicated as our group leader, he’d be the one who would gather us up for online meetings, in person meetings, and ask people questions and progress updates on how their part is going. Dong was our main person who worked on the mock-up website, and would double check on people’s work to make sure we’re staying on the original vision and goal of the project. Nam would be the person who came up with ideas to add on to the idea, as he was the one who was most passionate about Photography when we came up with the idea for the project, he’s also responsible creatively for how our project turned out.
            </div>
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Tool & Technologies</div>
            <div class="text">	For the tools and technologies that we used to make up the mock-up website, we mainly used VSC (Visual Studio Code) and GitHub. Dong being our main coder for the mock-up website, had contacts with people more proficient than us for advice and tips. They helped explain to us some more confusion around HTML, GitHub, CSS, and in the end recommended us VSC to help code the website more efficiently, with a live view of the website and its files, updating our GitHub repositories with a press of a button. GitHub, of course being the most useful tool of our project, as most developers would, allows for us to share files and work with each other, and lets us view our website in the first place.
            </div>
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Testing</div>
            <div class="text">For testing, we plan on relying on the results of manual testing by our group ourselves, but only on the earlier phases of development. As development goes on, we occasionally ask our contacts, to see if the website is up, or see if this button is working. If there is a problem that we’re stuck on, we also reach out to Dong's list of contacts who have knowledge in coding, and they would point out the problem. As the program gets further and more complicated, we will need a bigger sample of people to help us test out our website. If the website eventually becomes a functioning and sustaining business, we would consider hiring a team of testers.</div>
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Risks</div>
            <div class="text">The biggest risk that we have when running this business is that we are running an online website business. Due to the natural anonymity of the Internet, plenty of people are allowed to get away with committing malicious activities such as fraud, or scamming our clients, etc… So in order to counter this risk, we have to ask people who register for the website, more of their personal and important information, in order to hold them accountable for their actions on our website. However, to solve that risk, comes another risk that all websites hold, which is Cybersecurity, due to us holding our users’ personal information, that makes us an open target for hackers on the Internet. So in order to combat that again, we need to hire out for as much cybersecurity as we can on our website, which would cost a lot of money, and put this business in a financial risk situation as well.
            </div>
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Group processes & communication</div>
            <div class="text">For our group, for a majority of contact, we simply chatted about projects through text. However, we knew that wouldn’t be enough to get through a group project alone, so we did have calls as well, to be familiar with talking to each other. After we’re used to talking with each other, we resorted to meeting with each other face-to-face to talk about the project. Meeting in person wasn’t a very common occurrence, as we all had busy lives, as one would in college, however, it still helped the project development speed, as we were able to clear up misunderstandings, and reaffirm our roles and what is expected of each other.
            </div>
        <div class="head1">Skills & Jobs</div>
            <div class="text">If we were to lead a team of 4-5 people to continue this project and bring it to the next level, the main vital roles that we would need would be an Art Director, Web Designer, UI Designer, Data Analyst, Interaction Designer. The Art Director would be in charge of working with the Web and UI Designer, sort of as the overseer over all this project, because if we’ve learned anything, it’s that communication between your members in a projection is key, so having a dedicated role to that job is definitely worth its while. The Web Designer would be the one who codes the majority of the website, and designs the overall text, colors, images that the websites will utilize. In order to have a website function, you obviously need buttons and interface, so the UI designer would be in charge of that, and have to work with the Web Designer & Art Director to make sure the art direction remains consistent. The Data Analyst and the Interaction Designer would be working the closest with our clients and freelancers, the Data Analyst would look at the data and determine the wants and needs of our clients, such as there’s not enough filters, the buttons are unintuitive, etc… The Interaction Designer would be in charge of making that change that the Data Analyst had discovered, and find out the best way to allow users to communicate that information to us more.
            <br><br>
            Many skills are needed to run this team, with the most important being leadership and communication. Communication between both within the team, and the team and it’s users, to allow the website to constantly improve upon itself. Leadership is a skill that will help unite the group together, as members come from different backgrounds, it would be hard to start working with groups of people completely unfamiliar to them, to bring them together, to keep them on track, and set the vision for the project.
            </div>
        <div class="head1">Project Outcomes</div> 
            <div class="text">The functions of our product, which is a website, includes being able to register as either a client searching for a photographer, or a freelancing photographer searching for promotion in their work. A client would be able to filter through options such as price range, specialization, additional work such as photo editing, etc… A photographer would be able to custom tune his portfolio and profile visually to his liking, and present his important details that the client uses to filter through. One of the problems this helps solve is the creation of jobs. If photographers are able to consistently start their career through this website, we would be able to have more jobs in society, and the people who want to do photography out of passion, get to make it a reality dream job. It unfortunately cannot be used right away, its current state is only that of a mockup website with some draft visual designs programmed. In order to have it become a fully functional website, we would need a proper registration system with data storage of user’s data, which would require a lot of money and work. Even if we’re unable to have access to such a resource, we could still improve upon this system through improving its visual details, such as cleaner UI design, and better artstyle for the website.
            </div>
        <div class="head1">Group Reflection</div>  
            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Group Reflection</div>
            <div class="text">In terms of what we did well, we managed to make a project that we are relatively proud of despite our lack of people, and a problem with communication and a member mid way throughout our project. We think our earlier stages of communication could’ve been more direct with each other, however, it’s a given due to our natural anxiety when it comes to college, so we believed we did the best we could in contacting each other. For the presentation, we think we could’ve been a little bit more detailed with our idea, during the presentation, we were one of the groups who didn’t have a demo or a presentation ready, and one of our members didn’t show up, so one of us had to present lines that we weren’t responsible for. However, I think the presentation and speech wise, we did well on the timing and natural flow of our conversation, and answered the Q&A naturally. In terms of the mock-up website, I think we could’ve been more detailed and in-depth about its functionalities and visuals, but it being a mock-up website and our lack of experience, we are proud of what we’ve made. One thing that surprised all of us is how simple and quick a website could be set up and coded, this isn’t naturally exclusive to the project but as we’re all pretty new to IT, that whole concept is bizarre and wild to us. Setting up the website and coding it with each other, and being surprised that it worked so smoothly was an experience like no other, as learning new things always brings us a sense of joy. Overall, this group project taught us something important, it’s that knowing your group is the key to success, and communication is the key to knowing your group. All the strengths and weaknesses of our group all came from the source of communicating with each other, our most productive weeks came from contacting each other, and meeting in person, while our most unproductive weeks came from no one talking to each other at all, with not much work being done either. We hope to have learned from this group project, and do better in each and all of our individual group projects in future courses.

            <div class="head1" style="font-size:50px">Bui Xuan Quyen's Reflection</div>
            <div class="text">This course has been an exciting personal development when I have always wanted to learn about information technology. Being in the group with Nam and Dong is one of the most memorable experiences of my time in university. In the first place, we were arranged randomly, and the group consisted of 4 students. However, time flies and so did the fourth member of our group since only 1 day before the presentation he did not respond to our message. He did not show up for our presentation and Dong had to replace his section. Fortunately, with outstanding working ethics, Dong finished the tasks fluently and our presentation was decent. Dong was replacing the fourth member by himself and without Dong we would not finish the assignment easily. Personally, I could do more for the group as a member. However, since I attended four courses this semester, I barely have spare time to do extra work and the workload of our group was already up 30-60% compared to other groups. On the other hand, we learned to work under pressure, speeding up our process and controlling our problems with difficulties. I also wanted to appreciate the phenomenal effort that my teammates made for the group, it is not easy to finish the course without them.

            <div class="text">This project has been a mixture of fun and stressful to work on, it was fun to learn everything about the website and running an online website, however, the workload of the project combined with our number of workforce did not make for a fun combination. I was personally responsible for the mockup website, and it was a rollercoaster of a mess, as I found out how important CSS was to making a website, so I had to learn all of that before we decided to get started on the website, however, thankfully, with the help of some outside contacts, I was able to learn it pretty quickly. I was also the one responsible for replacing our previous member’s speech at the presentation at the last minute, as I helped him make his slides. I came from a background where English is a pretty common occurrence, so it isn’t as terrifying to me, so I was able to read off his part pretty well. There were definitely many things I could’ve done to help improve the project personally, such as looking over some people’s work that were taking a while to finish, calling off certain days on my schedule in order to have more time to work with the group, etc… I learned a lot about group work, it’s that you have to carry your part of the project just as much as anyone else. If one person is working twice as hard as someone else, then the group won’t work at its max efficiency.

            <div class="text" style="margin-bottom:50px">Throughout the course, I was able to learn how technology has changed our society over the years. After experiencing what it is like to work with technology, I got to do a project which requires me to work with other people. At the start of the project, I was a bit shy and did not have the confidence to communicate with my teammate properly. Gradually, after setting up a chat group on Facebook, I was more open to my team members due to the fact that I am more comfortable communicating online. As a result, discussions in class and outside of class were so much more effective. Secondly, using HTML and CSS was so much fun. It was a little bit hard at first but it did not strike as a challenge later on. Creating a website was mainly my idea and it was really interesting to see the idea that I have come up with turn into a reality. Overall, this course has taught me how to work with others and the way Information Technology has changed our lives completely.
